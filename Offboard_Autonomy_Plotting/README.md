# Project 2 

## Introduction 
  	This file includes python program solution for homework1 for
	UMD ENAE 788M Spring 2022 batch. The folders consists of python
	program along with some generated outputs a video. 
	
	These files are executable:
	
	path.py
    path_real.py
    time.py

	All other files are pictures and data
  
## Requirements
       ***Important****************************************************************
       *Change the path of the data file in all the 3 code.
	   *path_2 data file is used for time.py and path.py
	   *path data file is used for the path_real.py

       ****************************************************************************
       
### To run this code following libraries are required
 
* NumPy
* matplotlib.pyplot



* Run the following command which will generate the path taken by the drone
  in the given path folder
````
path.py
````
* Run the following command which will plot the actual trajactory or path that drone should have taken
````
 path_real.py
````
* Run the following command which will plot the graph of x,y,z directions in meters with respect to time
````
time.py
````



### Troubleshooting ###
	Most of the cases the issue will be incorrect file path.
	Double check the path by opening the properies of the video and images
	and copying path directly from there.

	For issues that you may encounter create an issue on GitHub.
